# sticky_lines
sticky_lines is a neovim plugin written in lua that's intended to speed-up development by allowing users to make "sticky lines" that they can easily jump between.

## Setting a sticky line
The command used to set sticky lines is `<leader>k`. This creates a sticky label at the current cursor position.

## Jumping to sticky line 
`<leader>j` is used to jump to sticky lines and will jump to the last sticky line.
